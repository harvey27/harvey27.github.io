## Big O Notation

Big O Notation was one those concepts that always seemed to escape me. Sure I could, if asked in an interview respond with the overtly simple "Big O Notation is a metric to measure an algorithm performance". Ask me to explain any further and I would be in a world of confusion and disarray! But after reading multiple blog posts and doing some  homework I finally have a grasp of the concept. So here is my attempt to explain it to you!

## What is it anyway and why does it matter to me?

Big O Notation is a metric to measure the theoretical speed it takes to compute an algorithm. Sure you can assume that a loop through an array of ten items will be faster than with an array of ten thousand items but how much faster and why? Well Big O Notation helps to explain just that. The bigger and more complex your application grows the more performance starts to become important and understanding the Big O Notation of it's algorithm can make a world of difference. So lets get into it!

<strong> O(1) </strong>

O(1) is quite simple. It simply means that the theoretical speed will remain constant and not be dependent on the size of the data structure.
{% highlight ruby %}
  hash = { name: "DHH", job: "Basecamp", }
  hash[:name]
{% endhighlight %}
The hash could have a thousand items or ten thousand items in it and the theoretical speed will remain constant. This is the fastest of the different Big O Notations.

<strong> O(n) </strong>

O(n) mean the algorithm will increase linearly depending on the size of the data structure. If 10 elements are added onto the data structure it will take 10 times longer to compute. If 100 elements are added it will take 100 times longer and so on. O(n) algorithms typically involve a simple loop through a data structure ie:
{% highlight ruby %}
  numbers = (1..100)
  numbers.each do |x|
    x.odd? ? (puts "Odd" ) : (puts "Even")
  end
{% endhighlight %}


<strong> O(n^2) </strong>

O(n^2) is very similar to O(n). Except for every element added to the dataset the amount of time increases exponentially instead of linearly. O(n^2) is usually involved with nested loops
{% highlight ruby %}
  numbers = (1..100)
  numbers.each do |x|
    numbers.each do |y|
      p x, y
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
For every single number in the range the algorithm has to loop through the entire array again. It's easy to see why you should avoid O(n^2) algorithms.

That's just a small taste of the most common Big O Notations you will run into. If you wish to expand your knowledge of the subject I recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Big O Notation Cheat Sheet </a>. Well that's all from me folk! Like the great Avdi Grimm says "Happy Hacking!"
